checks:
  file-lines:
    config:
      # Spec files can run way above 250, and splitting them
      # artificially breaks the filename mapping logic.
      threshold: 1000
  similar-code:
    config:
      # Spec files can have a lot of similar literals, but
      # DRYing them out degrades the readibility of the tests
      # most of the time, so weâ€™re upping the threshold from 2 to 4
      # (which admittedly would start being a bit much).
      threshold: 4
